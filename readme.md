<p itemprop="abstract">
  boomshak is a toolkit for rendering text using SVG.
  The font itself is directly inspired by the PICO-8 fantasy
  console's built-in pixel font.
  The toolkit as a whole is inspired more generally by the
  simplicity of PICO-8's design and the creativity of the
  PICO-8 community in pushing its boundaries.
  I wanted to bring some of that magic to the stuff I do on the
  web, and boomshak is part of that.
  So the package is as simple and flexible as possible so that
  it's usable for all kinds of different ideas and projects.
