<p itemprop="abstract">
  boomshak is a toolkit for rendering text using SVG.
  The font itself is directly inspired by the built-in pixel
  font in the PICO-8 fantasy console.
  The toolkit as a whole is inspired more generally by the
  simplicity of PICO-8's design and the creativity of the
  PICO-8 community in pushing the boundaries of the platform.
