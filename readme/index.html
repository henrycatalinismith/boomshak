<h1>boomshak</h1>
<p>Vector font toolkit inspired by PICO-8</p>
<p>boomshak is a toolkit for rendering text using SVG.
The font itself is directly inspired by the <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a> fantasy
console's built-in pixel font.
The toolkit as a whole is inspired more generally by the
simplicity of PICO-8's design and the creativity of the
PICO-8 community in pushing its boundaries.
I wanted to bring some of that magic to the stuff I do on the
web, and boomshak is part of that.
So the package is as simple and flexible as possible so that
it's usable for all kinds of different ideas and projects.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>I've really just written this for myself to use, but you're
welcome to install the npm package and try it too. I'm not gonna
document the setup process or APIs or anything right now though,
because it'd set the wrong expectations. This is really more of
a private package that I'm open sourcing because there's no
reason not to, rather than an open source project I'm trying to
start. Let me know if you do use it for something though
because I'm open to changing that.</p>

<p>Really grateful to Lexaloffle for <a href="https://twitter.com/lexaloffle/status/873657107203080192?lang=en">licensing the PICO-8 font
under CC-0</a>, so I'll pay it forward and use the
same license here. If you find something here that you wanna
copy then go ahead!</p>
